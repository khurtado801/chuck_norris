# Chuck Norris

## In this project I created a simple React App that will find and return Chuck Norris jokes. This was created with React and Redux.



## `Categories` page:
  * Fetch a list of all the joke categories and display them in a list 
  * Each category in the list clickable
  * When a category is clicked it shows a random joke from that category (ex: open a dialog with a joke)

## `Jokes` page:
  * Results of the search query are displayed in a list
  * Each listed joke is clickable
  * When a joke is selected it is displayed (ex: open a dialog the joke)
